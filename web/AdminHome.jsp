        <h1>The Cloud platform provides various services to its users and one of the important zones of service is the security of the information stored. This project proposes an enhanced approach of a complex Hybrid encryption system involving a Symmetric and an Asymmetric key encryption technique to secure the information on the cloud platform from potential attacks like encryption failure, man-in-middle attack and Insider attack etc along with a hashing technique for the key.</h1>
